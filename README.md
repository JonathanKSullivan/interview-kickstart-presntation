# README for "Functional Programming in Python" Presentation

## Overview
This README accompanies the presentation "Optimizing Fleet Management with Python: A Hands-On Approach to Data Structures and Functional Programming." The presentation is designed to introduce and explore the application of Python's data structures and functional programming concepts to solve real-world problems in fleet management, specifically focusing on optimizing the operations of a drone fleet.

## Presentation Structure
The presentation is structured into several key sections, each aiming to build upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Python can be used to enhance fleet management systems. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the sections:

1. **Title Slide**: Introduces the presentation topic.
2. **Welcome & Introduction**: Sets the stage for what will be covered, including Python data structures and functional programming concepts.
3. **Engagement Poll**: An interactive poll to gauge the audience's familiarity with Python's data structures and functional programming.
4. **Objectives**: Overview of the main objectives and what attendees will learn.
5. **Understanding Python Data Structures**: Dives into tuples, sets, and dictionaries, demonstrating their use in efficient data management.
6. **Functional Programming in Python**: Explores the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions, illustrating their application in data manipulation.
7. **Comprehensive Challenge**: Introduces a challenge that combines all learned concepts to optimize delivery routes for a drone fleet.
8. **Conclusion & Key Takeaways**: Summarizes the key points covered and the practical applications of the session.
9. **Q&A and Thanks**: Opens the floor for questions and provides additional resources for further learning.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Reveal.js**: The presentation is built using Reveal.js, a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code snippets are highlighted using the Monokai theme for clarity and readability.
- **Interactive Poll**: Engages the audience through a Slido poll, encouraging participation and understanding of the audience's baseline knowledge.

## Audience
This presentation is aimed at professionals and enthusiasts in the software development and logistics industries, particularly those interested in applying programming to solve logistical challenges. Attendees are expected to have a basic understanding of programming concepts, though familiarity with Python is not a prerequisite.

## Resources
Attendees are encouraged to follow along and participate in the live coding exercises. A companion Jupyter notebook is available, allowing attendees to explore Python's data structures and functional programming hands-on. Additional resources for further study and deep dives into Python programming are provided at the end of the presentation.

## Feedback and Contact Information
Feedback is highly appreciated as it helps improve future presentations. For any questions, clarifications, or discussions, attendees can contact the presenter at Jonathan.K.Sullivan@gmail.com. Networking and professional connections are encouraged, and the presenter is available on LinkedIn.
